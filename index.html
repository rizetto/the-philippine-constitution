            Overtime, the Philippine constitution has evolved in different eras. With each iteration of it having
            focused on one specific problem, may it the inequality amonst men in the country, to develop business and
            promotion, and the many more. Let's take a look at the Philippine Constitution throughout the years.

        <h3>Japanese Era</h3>
        <div class="article-body">
          <img src="./img/eras/japanese.webp" alt="">
          <p>The 1943 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, composed of a preamble and twelve articles,
            creates a Republican state with a powerful executive branch and subordinate legislative and judicial
            branches. The executive power is vested in the President, who is to be elected by the members of the
            National Assembly from among themselves. The President is the head of government, and commander-in-chief of
            the Armed Forces. The powers of the President are: to veto any bill of the Assembly, to promulgate
            regulations when the Assembly is not in session and in times of war or national emergency, to declare
            martial law, to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and to appoint the members of the
            Council of State and officials of the local government. A limited legislative power is exercised by the
            unicameral National Assembly whose members, like the President, are not directly elected by the people.
            Rather, the Assembly is to be composed of representatives from each province elected in Kalibapi conventions
            throughout the country with appointed governors and mayors as ex-officio members. The judicial power is
            exercised by the Supreme Court whose justices, together with judges of lower courts, are to be appointed by
            the President. The 1943 Constitution enumerates the duties and rights of the citizens, requires the
            government to develop Tagalog as the national language, and stipulates that one year after the termination
            of the Great East Asia War or the World War II; a new constitution shall be formulated and adopted to
            replace this Constitution.</p>
          <p>
            The 1943 Constitution was the constitution of the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic of the Philippines
            (1943-1945). It was recognized as legitimate and binding only in Japanese-controlled areas of the
            Philippines but was ignored by the United States government and the Philippine Commonwealth government
            in-exile. In June 1943, the Preparatory Commission for Philippine Independence (PCPI), composed of 20
            delegates, was created to draft a new constitution by the Kalibapi [Kapisanan sa Paglilingkod sa Bagong
            Pilipinas], the only political organization allowed at that time. The Japanese monitored the drafting of the
            constitution and instructed the members of PCPI, led by Jose P. Laurel, that the constitution should conform
            with the principles of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In September 1943, the draft constitution
            was unanimously approved by all members of the PCPI and was submitted for ratification in a popular
            convention of the Kalibapi in Manila.

          <p>
            The Philippines has had a total of six constitutions since the Proclamation of Independence on June 12,
            1898. In 1899, the Malolos Constitution, the first Philippine Constitution—the first republican constitution
            in Asia—was drafted and adopted by the First Philippine Republic, which lasted from 1899 to 1901.
          </p>
          <p>During the American Occupation, the Philippines was governed by the laws of the United States of America.
            Organic Acts were passed by the United States Congress for the administration of the Government of the
            Philippine Islands. The first was the Philippine Organic Act of 1902, which provided for a Philippine
            Assembly composed of Filipino citizens. The second was the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916, which included
            the first pledge of Philippine independence. These laws served as constitutions of the Philippines from 1902
            to 1935.</p>
          <p>
            In 1934, the United States Congress passed the Philippine Independence Act, which set the parameters for the
            creation of a constitution for the Philippines. The Act mandated the Philippine Legislature to call for an
            election of delegates to a Constitutional Convention to draft a Constitution for the Philippines. The 1934
            Constitutional Convention finished its work on February 8, 1935. The Constitution was submitted to the
            President of the United States for certification on March 25, 1935. It was in accordance with the Philippine
            Independence Act of 1934. The 1935 Constitution was ratified by the Filipino people through a national
            plebiscite, on May 14, 1935 and came into full force and effect on November 15, 1935 with the inauguration
            of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Among its provisions was that it would remain the constitution of
            the Republic of the Philippines once independence was granted on July 4, 1946.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1940, the 1935 Constitution was amended by the National Assembly of the Philippines. The legislature was
            changed from a unicameral assembly to a bicameral congress. The amendment also changed the term limit of the
            President of the Philippines from six years with no reelection to four years with a possibility of being
            reelected for a second term.

            Approved by the 1986 Constitutional Commission on October 12, 1986, the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of
            the Philippines was presented to President Corazon C. Aquino on October 15, 1986. It was ratified on
            February 2, 1987 by a plebiscite. It was proclaimed in force on February 11, 1987.

          <p>
            The current Philippine Constitutions promotes the independence of the country from the hands of the
            oppressor as well as the basic human rights of a person.
            Furthermore, it's goal is also to promote equality among the country men.
